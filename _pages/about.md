About Me
------
I am a master at the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The University of Tongji. My supervisor is Professor Chengju Liu. My research interests cover computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with special emphasis on multimodal AI, vision and language, open-world recognition, and generative models. I have published several papers in top conferences such as ACMMM, ICML, IJCAI.
